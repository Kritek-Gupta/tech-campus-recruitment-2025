# Log Extractor: Solution Discussion

## Solutions Considered

### 1. Single-threaded Log Processing

- Initial approach: Sequential line-by-line processing
- **Pros**: Simple implementation, easy to understand
- **Cons**: Not scalable for large files, inefficient processing

### 2. Multi-threaded Log Processing

- Parallel processing using file chunks
- **Pros**: Improved performance through concurrency
- **Cons**: Complex synchronization, chunk management challenges

### 3. Multi-threaded Log Processing with Mutexes (Chosen Solution)

- **Implementation Details:**

  - Parallel processing with thread-safe error handling
  - Efficient chunk merging using buffered I/O
  - Memory-optimized for large file processing

- **Technical Architecture:**

  1. **File Processing:**

     - Divides log file into manageable chunks
     - Each chunk processed by dedicated thread
     - Matches target date and writes to temporary files

  2. **Thread Safety:**

     - Mutex implementation for error handling
     - Synchronized access to shared resources
     - Controlled temporary file management

  3. **I/O Management:**
     - Buffered I/O for efficient chunk merging
     - Automatic directory creation and cleanup
     - Optimized memory utilization

- **Key Benefits:**

  - **Performance:** Optimized multi-core utilization
  - **Scalability:** Efficient large file handling
  - **Reliability:** Thread-safe error management
  - **Maintainability:** Modular code structure

- **System Requirements:**

  - C++17 or later compiler
  - Standard library support
  - Threading capabilities

- **Usage Instructions:**

  bash/instructions
  # Compile
  g++ -std=c++17 extract_logs.cpp -o extract_logs -pthread

  # Execute
  ./extract_logs YYYY-MM-DD
  

- **Output Management:**
  - Filtered logs saved to `../output/output_YYYY-MM-DD.txt`
  - Temporary files automatically cleaned up
  - Error reporting via console output
